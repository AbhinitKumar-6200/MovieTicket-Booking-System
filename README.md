<b>Movie Booking System<b>
The Movie Booking System is a console-based Java application built using a clean layered architecture approach.

It simulates a real-world movie ticket booking platform where users can:
- View available movies
- Check show timings
- View seat availability
- Book multiple seats
- Cancel bookings
- Track booking details

This project is designed to demonstrate strong understanding of:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Layered Architecture (DAO → Service → Main)
- In-memory data handling
- Exception handling
- Java Collections
- LocalDateTime API
